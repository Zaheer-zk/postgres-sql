# PostgreSQL Learning Repository

This repository contains code examples and resources for learning PostgreSQL, a powerful open-source relational database management system.

## Getting Started

To get started with PostgreSQL, you'll need to follow these steps:

1. **Installation**: Install PostgreSQL on your local machine. You can download the installer from the [official PostgreSQL website](https://www.postgresql.org/download/). Alternatively, you can use Docker to run PostgreSQL in a container.

2. **Setup**: After installing PostgreSQL, set up your database server. You may need to configure authentication, create users, and set up databases.

3. **Connecting to the Database**: Use a PostgreSQL client tool or library to connect to your database server. Common tools include psql (command-line client), pgAdmin (GUI client), and various programming language-specific libraries.

## Contents
